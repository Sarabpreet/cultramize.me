	User Experience Design or UXD has become one of the important paradigms for product design, when it comes to media sciences, web application, mobile application, desktop applications etc., good usability is one necessary condition for the survival of the product. Let’s take an example of Facebook, Facebook’s one of the main feature is sharing contents (thoughts, good or bad), what if Facebook’s user interface failed to make user go to the form and submit the content that easily then what it is now, would Facebook be one of the top social media website then? If users get distracted from the main purpose of a product, the user might leave or stop using the product. When it comes to websites, there is no such thing as “web manual” or how to use a website guide. A user should be able to find and browse the website without even knowing or reading the website manual, user must take less time to figure out the interface of a website, until he finds it. The time phrase where users tries to figure out the content should be as less as possible, since it creates a chance for distraction in user’s mind. Since there is millions of website a user has all the options to leave within that waiting time phrase. These are the few reasons why user experience design is important and should be considered before the product launch.

  <h3>Why Colors are important</h3>

<p>Colours are an essential part of UXD, for a good user interface design one should use colour conservatively. Limiting the number of colour and amount of hue in colours recognizing the colour which speeds or slows the task, being able to see colour with minimal user effort, consistence in colour coding and using colour in graphic displays for greater information is one of the practical implementations user experience strategist are doing in order for a better UXD.</p>

  <h3>Other Web Elements </h3>
<p>Elements like navigation, header, footer, images, sounds/music and animations, sound also have a key to improve user experience design however it is not considered a good practice to put sound in a product based or website which shares information as it might distract users from the main purpose of the website.
