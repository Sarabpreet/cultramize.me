<h2>About Cultramize.me</h2>

<p>
	

	Cultramize.me is the live working project which we implemented our studies on, we took out the colour pallet from our website matrix and extracted 3 colours which were used the most. We put it in an array of variables inside the php script and got it evoked by get requests, on the client side. The script will ask the user their preferred country (China, United States, India, Japan, and Brazil) and store the option in a variable.  The other script will get that information and start inserting the colour variables into the less variables using file handling, later then we could use lessphp for compiling it into css. After this job we can simply compress the entire folder where bootstrap theme exists, and pass the link to a redirected website which will have the download option.  Following is the blue print on how cultramize.me works.
